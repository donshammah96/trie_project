# Trie-Based String Operations System

A C implementation of a trie (prefix tree) data structure that provides autocomplete functionality, spell checking, and word prediction capabilities.

## Overview

This program demonstrates the power of trie data structures for efficient string operations. A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings character by character, making it ideal for applications that need fast prefix-based searches.

## Features

### 1. **Autocomplete**
- Suggests all possible words that start with a given prefix
- Efficient prefix-based word completion
- Perfect for search engines and text editors

### 2. **Spell Checker**
- Detects misspelled words
- Suggests corrections using single-character edits:
  - Character insertions
  - Character deletions  
  - Character substitutions
- Uses edit distance of 1 for suggestions

### 3. **Word Prediction**
- Predicts possible next words based on input prefix
- Useful for predictive text applications

### 4. **Memory Management**
- Proper memory allocation and deallocation
- Prevents memory leaks through recursive cleanup

## Compilation and Usage

### Compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o trie main.c trie.c
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./trie
```

## Example Output

```
==== Autocomplete Demo =====
Autocomplete suggestions for 'ca':
cat
car
cart
cake

==== Spell Checker Demo =====
'kat' is misspelled. Possible corrections:
cat

==== Word Prediction Demo =====
Word predictions for 'ca':
cat
car
cart
cake
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

```c
TrieNode* createNode();                           // Creates a new trie node
void insert(TrieNode* root, const char* word);    // Inserts a word into the trie
bool search(TrieNode* root, const char* word);    // Searches for a word in the trie
void autocomplete(TrieNode* root, const char* prefix);  // Shows autocomplete suggestions
void spellCheck(TrieNode* root, const char* word);      // Checks spelling and suggests corrections
void predictNextWord(TrieNode* root, const char* prefix); // Predicts next possible words
void freeTrie(TrieNode* root);                    // Frees allocated memory
```

## Technical Details

### Time Complexity
- **Insert**: O(m) where m is the length of the word
- **Search**: O(m) where m is the length of the word
- **Autocomplete**: O(p + n) where p is prefix length and n is number of matching words
- **Spell Check**: O(m × 26 × 3) for single-character edits

### Space Complexity
- **Storage**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE × N × M) where N is number of words and M is average word length
- **Memory per node**: 26 pointers + 1 boolean flag

### Limitations
- Currently supports only lowercase English letters (a-z)
- Uses fixed alphabet size of 26
- Spell checker only suggests single-character edits

## Possible Improvements

### 1. **Extended Character Support**
- Support uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Unicode support for international languages
- Dynamic alphabet sizing

### 2. **Enhanced Spell Checking**
- Implement Levenshtein distance for multi-character edits
- Add phonetic matching (Soundex, Metaphone)
- Support for transposition errors
- Weighted suggestions based on character proximity on keyboard

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Compressed trie (Patricia trie) to reduce memory usage
- Cache frequently accessed nodes
- Implement iterative versions to avoid stack overflow
- Add path compression for single-child chains

### 4. **Advanced Features**
- Word frequency tracking for better predictions
- Context-aware suggestions
- Fuzzy matching with configurable tolerance
- Batch operations for multiple words
- Persistent storage (save/load trie from file)

### 5. **User Interface Improvements**
- Interactive command-line interface
- Configuration options for suggestion limits
- Colored output for better readability
- Progress indicators for large operations

### 6. **Data Structure Enhancements**
- Ternary Search Trie for memory efficiency
- Suffix tree integration for advanced pattern matching
- Bloom filters for quick negative lookups
- LRU cache for recent searches

### 7. **Algorithm Improvements**
- Implement BK-Tree for efficient spell checking
- Add n-gram support for better predictions
- Machine learning integration for personalized suggestions
- Parallel processing for large datasets

### 8. **Testing and Validation**
- Unit tests for all functions
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
- Stress testing with large dictionaries
